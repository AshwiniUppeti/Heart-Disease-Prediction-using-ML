Heart Disease Prediction
This repository contains a Python script for predicting heart disease using a Logistic Regression model. The model is trained on a dataset with various health-related attributes to predict whether an individual has heart disease.
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health parameters. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally, and early detection is crucial in managing and potentially preventing heart-related complications. This project leverages a Logistic Regression model, a widely used statistical method for binary classification, to analyze and predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.
Dataset
The dataset used for training is expected to have the following columns:

age
sex
cp (chest pain type)
trestbps (resting blood pressure)
chol (serum cholesterol in mg/dl)
fbs (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)
restecg (resting electrocardiographic results)
thalach (maximum heart rate achieved)
exang (exercise-induced angina)
oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest)
slope (the slope of the peak exercise ST segment)
ca (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy)
thal (thalassemia)
target (1: presence of heart disease, 0: absence of heart disease)
